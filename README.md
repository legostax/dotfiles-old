# LegoStax's Dotfiles

[My new dotfiles running Sway](https://github.com/legostax/dotfiles)

Here's the files that enable [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) to work how I want on my machine.  [Check it out on Reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6drt6c/awesomewm_noobs_paradise/)

Dependencies: AwesomeWM, mpd, Pulseaudio

3/4 Wallpapers were found browsing the interwebs.  The Daft Punk one was made by one of my [buddies](https://twitter.com/VoltivTV).  I probably don't have the rights to distribute those other 3 wallpapers.  But, who cares?  Not anyone who's looking for dotfiles.

## Features
- Multi-monitor support
- Animations via `tween.lua`
- Custom integrated lockscreen
- Music (MPD) integration. I quit developing the custom python music server because it used a lot of weird hacks that didn't work 100% of the time.
- Scalable app menu entries
- Other aesthetically pleasing things
- Quite a few keyboard shortcuts
- [Check out some screenies](http://imgur.com/gallery/E9dQ0)

## Setup/Installation

- Install AwesomeWM 4.2
- Clone this repository into `~/.config/awesome/`
- Edit `themes/default/theme.lua` to match the location of your `~/.config/awesome`
- Make changes to the audio input setup to ensure that the music player will work with your audio setup
- Change the `screenLockPin` to something other than the default **1234**

Right-click on the desktop and click Hotkeys to see a list of all of the keybinds.

Ensure your `~/.face` is at least 400x400 in size for the lockscreen to look right.

Poke around for other things to tweak to your liking. Have fun!

## TODO

- Fix tagline animation glitch where it doesn't always move with the workspace
- Disable naughty on lockscreen
- Fix wibox being transparent when it's supposed to be opaque, and vice versa
- Make the top drag region to maximize, and remove the bottom drag region
- Theme the drag regions so that they aren't disgusting generic red boxes
- Fix setting audio output

This stuff will be fixed in v2.0.
